# Distributed Medical Image Processing with MONAI

## Overview

Build a distributed medical image registration pipeline using MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) on Snowflake's Container Runtime with GPU acceleration. This guide demonstrates how to train and deploy deep learning models for aligning lung CT scans using Ray for distributed computing and Snowflake's Model Registry for model management.
